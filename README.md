# ECE-661-Final-Project
Noise-aware DNN training: Combating adversarial noise with simple noise-based input perturbations

Several files in for this project came from ECE 661 at Duke University. These files are essential to the final code for the project. The files are: dataset.py, resnet20.py, and FP_layers.py.
